# 🎓 Campus Connect

> A unified, student-centric platform designed to bridge the gap between scattered resources, collaboration challenges, and unaffordable campus essentials.

## ❌ Pain Points

- Students often rely on **5–6 different sources** (WhatsApp groups, Drive links, random seniors, etc.) to collect notes, lab manuals, and guides.  
- For hackathons, class projects, or competitions, students spend **3–5 days** just finding teammates with complementary skills.  
- **72%** reported “missing deadlines or giving up” because they couldn’t form effective teams in time.  
- Students often purchase brand-new items (books, lab kits, instruments) that seniors no longer need, causing unnecessary expense.  
- On average, students spend **₹3,000–₹5,000 extra per semester** on supplies that could have been reused.
